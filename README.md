## My process

1. **Data Handling**: Imported testimonials data from a JSON file.
2. **State Management**: Used React's `useState` hook to manage the current slide index.
3. **Transitions**: Implemented smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions using CSS classes.
4. **Responsive Design**: Utilized Tailwind CSS utilities and media queries to ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on all screen sizes.
5. **Background Positioning**: Adjusted background image positioning for large screens.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https:///) - For styles



### What I learned

- **React Basics**: Reinforced my understanding of React hooks, particularly `useState`, for managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Gained proficiency in using Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **CSS Transitions**: Learned how to create smooth transitions between different states using CSS animations.
- **Responsive Design**: Improved my skills in making responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes using media queries.


### Continued development


Future improvements and features I plan to add include:
- **Autoplay Feature**: Automatically transition between testimonials after a set interval.
- **Pause on Hover**: Pause the autoplay feature when the user hovers over the testimonials section.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve keyboard navigation and add ARIA attributes for better accessibility.
